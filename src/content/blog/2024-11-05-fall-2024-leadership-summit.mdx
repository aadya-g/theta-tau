For the first time in TT history, our brothers currently holding leadership positions embarked on a hike at Devilâ€™s Lake, WI, planned by our Vice Regent Katie Mangus and Regent Sami Breault! During this hike, chair positions and executive members discussed plans for the semester, different types of leadership styles, and areas for growth in their positions and the fraternity.

By starting this new tradition, our TT leaders wanted to give members a unique opportunity to learn about different leadership styles, self-reflect, and collaborate on ways to improve both individually and as a team.

Katie shared that one of the primary motivations behind starting the Leadership Summit was the aspiration to foster growth and build stronger relationships between brothers through shared experiences and open conversation. She believes that it is really important to reflect on where you personally excel, and identify any areas for growth within yourself. Additionally, by taking the time to connect outside of regular meetings and work with people holding other positions, members were able to build stronger relationships that made them more effective as a team.

Ultimately, the first ever leadership summit was incredibly helpful for all who participated, and laid the foundation for an amazing semester to come! A huge thank you to Katie and Sami for starting what is sure to become a recurring tradition in TT!
