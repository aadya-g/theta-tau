## About Sami

Sami is a junior studying Biomedical Engineering from Mukwonago, WI. She rushed in her freshman year, in Spring of 2023, and has quickly become an integral part of the fraternity. When she rushed, she was looking for a place where she could meet people with similar aspirations and goals, who valued both professional development and personal connections with brothers. Outside of her busy academic schedule, Sami loves running and being outdoors, as well as baking things like delicious bagels from scratch!

## Previous Experience

In her past one and a half years in the fraternity, Sami has held positions of Historian and Scribe, with Scribe being her personal favorite. As the Scribe, Sami realized how much she enjoyed being active in the fraternity, and making a difference in her own way. The role not only enhanced her leadership skills but also helped her feel more comfortable stepping out of her comfort zone into more of an authority position. One of Sami's favorite memories from being in Theta Tau was the first brotherhood retreat she went on. She specifically loved having conversations with members around the bonfire, which helped her see how Theta Tau has positively impacted so many people.

## Goals for the Future

As the 2024 Fall Regent, Sami aims to facilitate collaboration among members and chair positions to create as inclusive an environment as possible. She hopes to maintain a space where everyone feels empowered to share their ideas. Sami feels strongly about these goals because Theta Tau has made her feel incredibly safe and welcome, and she wants to ensure that others feel the same way.

We are so excited to see what Sami has in store for this semester, and we know she will make an amazing leader and mentor in TT! Congratulations, Sami!
