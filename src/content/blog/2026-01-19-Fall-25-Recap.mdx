## Fall 2025 Semester Recap
### A recap of a phenomenal semester at Theta Tau - Xi Chapter
*Written by Leonardo Losch*

Winter Break is wrapping up, and with ample time to reflect, we look back on an absolutely wonderful fall semester for Theta Tau. Another successful semester was marked by new member growth, continued involvement from current members, and a strong commitment to Theta Tau’s three core pillars: Professional Development, Community Service, and Brotherhood. Listed below are some of the highlights, with insight from those who served as chairs.

## Professional Development

This semester, Paulina Castaneda served as PD Chair. Leading a committee, Paulina and her team assisted members in preparing for industry roles, building confidence, and strengthening our chapter’s industry reputation. Some highlights included extensive career fair preparation with internal resume reviews and mock interviews, securing three company sponsorships, a Working Genius event that helped brothers better understand teamwork and communication styles, and implementing a mentorship program with Sub-Zero. One of the most impactful events was the Know Before You Go panel with our alumni as pre–career fair preparation. Bridging the gap between members and alumni through real-world insights boosted confidence and helped prepare our brothers to attend the career fair and land jobs. Beyond these events, Paulina also emphasized the importance of representation and belonging in engineering, sharing the following insight:

“From a more personal perspective, as a first-generation college student, PD has given me the tools, confidence, and community I needed to navigate spaces that often feel intimidating for students without prior exposure to engineering careers. Through these events, I’ve learned that my voice not only belongs in these rooms, it can and should be heard. As our chapter continues to grow as leaders within the College of Engineering, my hope is to keep amplifying the voices of members who are often less seen or less represented. Professional development is more than resumes and career fairs; it is a pathway to equity, opportunity, and empowerment.”

Paulina crushed it and plans to continue her leadership by serving as Regent for the spring semester.

## Community Service

Expanding our outreach beyond just our own members, Evan Loe and his committee led community service initiatives throughout the semester. Some highlights included volunteering at The Beacon, a day resource center for individuals experiencing homelessness, participating in blood drives, arboretum restoration, and STEM outreach events in partnership with Centro Hispano and Girl Scouts. Evan emphasized the importance of our partnership with The Beacon as our strongest community service relationship:

“[They] support a vital resource hub for the Madison homeless population through services such as resume reviews, interview prep, grounds cleaning, and food preparation, allowing our members to gain hands-on opportunities to invest in our community.”

Community service also provided opportunities for brothers to share their passion for engineering in meaningful ways with youth. 

“I also really enjoyed working with members Emma Cavazos, Lily Tapparo, and Sabrina Garcia on a STEM outreach event with Centro Hispano and a Girl Scouts troop. It was exciting to share our passion for engineering with local youth and expose them to the career field. We led the groups through the engineering design process by building balloon cars.”

Participating in these events allowed brothers to be part of something bigger than themselves and make a visible impact in the community.

## Brotherhood

This semester, Siri Stolen led the Brotherhood pillar, focusing on creating spaces where members could connect and feel a strong sense of belonging within the chapter. Through events such as the Brotherhood Retreat in Northern Wisconsin, Fratsgiving, and Pumpkin Carving, Siri and her committee organized meaningful experiences that strengthened relationships not only among current members, but also between members and new pledge classes. One of the most impactful ongoing initiatives was Food Fridays, which consistently brought brothers together in a welcoming environment. As Siri shared:

“Food Fridays were the most impactful because they gave everyone a place to come together and share a meal, creating a low-pressure space where members could genuinely connect. They also helped include brothers who don’t usually attend many events and gave new members an easy way to meet people and find their place in the chapter.”

When asked why brotherhood was important, Siri elaborated:

“It helps create a sense of belonging within both engineering and the broader UW–Madison campus, connecting members with people who understand the demands of similar courses, heavy workloads, and shared interests. It also offers valuable mentorship through bigs and littles, along with guidance from older members who have already navigated the same challenges.”

From a personal perspective, I can attest that brotherhood was the best part of Theta Tau. Being part of a community and creating friendships with brothers who share the same values made the good times really great and the stressful times way easier to get through.

## Regent Remarks

Lastly, I spoke with Ike Fritz, our Regent, about his reflections on the semester. He shared that this semester stood out for several reasons. First, the sheer number of events was nonstop, almost to the point where committees had to race to claim open calendar slots. There was also a strong emphasis on community and inclusion, with many younger members stepping into leadership positions and responsibilities. This semester marked the largest chapter size we have ever had, along with advancements in our sponsorship programs. Additionally, Ike and Vice Regent Liza Robinson focused heavily on increasing internal dialogue about areas for improvement, hosting meetings to implement changes and learn from feedback.

Overall, the Fall 2025 semester will be remembered as an incredible time for our chapter, and the future is looking very bright. We look forward to returning to campus and picking up right where we left off. See you soon!
