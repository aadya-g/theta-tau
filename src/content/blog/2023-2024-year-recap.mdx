After a year of bonding with brothers, giving back to the community, and building
professional skills, the 2023-2024 school year is coming to an end. Here are all
the fun and exciting activities the brothers of the Xi chapter engaged in this year:

## Community Service

Our brothers dived into a variety of activities this year, from building to raking to crafting. We kicked off the year by participating in the Habitat for Humanity Rake-a-thon, dedicating a morning to raking leaves at local houses to raise money for a sponsored home. Following that, some of our brothers took part in a Habitat for Humanity build. As winter waned, we journeyed to Sun Prairie Park, where we assisted in restoring the park by de-weeding and planting grass seed. During study sessions, we crafted cards for Cardz for Kidz and made tie blankets, handmade jewelry, and more for the UW Children's Hospital.

## Professional Development

This year, we had the privilege of visiting and hearing from several nationwide engineering companies. Brothers put on their hard hats for Findorff site visits to the Oliv apartments and the new CDIS building on campus. Additionally, a panel from GE Healthcare visited us, shining light on engineering in the healthcare industry. Things took a cool turn when a Sub-Zero representative spoke to us about company culture, career advice, and professional opportunities. Throughout the year, we honed our professional skills through resume reviews, career fair preparation, and a LinkedIn workshop.

## Brotherhood

Lastly, we strengthened our bonds and created lasting memories through various brotherhood activities. To embrace the fall weather, we carved Halloween pumpkins and enjoyed a scenic s'mores night at Picnic Point. We also attended a Madison Capitols Hockey game and organized a fun ice cream social. And, of course, we had plenty of Food Fridays, including a holiday special featuring traditional Kwanzaa and Hanukkah fare.

That wraps up the Xi chapter's activities for this year. See you in the fall!
