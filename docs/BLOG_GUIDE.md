# Blog Chair Guide

This guide provides instructions for the Blog Chair on how to create and manage blog posts for the Theta Tau website.

## Creating a New Blog Post

### Step 1: Create the Blog Post File

1. Navigate to the `src/content/blog` directory on the GitHub website.
2. Click the "Add file" button, then choose "Create new file."
3. Name your file with the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post.md`.
   - Example: `2024-01-15-winter-rush-recap.md`.

### Step 2: Add Front Matter

At the top of your Markdown file, include the following front matter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Blog Post Title"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
author: "Your Name"
image: "/images/blog/your-image.jpg"
---
```

### Step 3: Add Content

Write your blog post content using Markdown formatting:

- Use `#` for headings (## for h2, ### for h3, etc.).
- Use `*` or `_` for *italics*.
- Use `**` or `__` for **bold**.
- Use `-` or `*` for bullet points.
- Use `1.` for numbered lists.
- Use `[text](url)` for links.
- Use `![alt text](image-url)` for images.

Example:
```markdown

```

### Step 4: Adding Images

1. Navigate to the `public/blog` directory on the GitHub website.
2. Click the "Add file" button, then upload your images.
3. Use descriptive names for your images (e.g., `winter-rush-2024.jpg`).
4. Reference the images in your blog post using the path `/blog/your-image.jpg`.

#### Image Formatting Options

You have two ways to add images to your blog posts:

1. **Simple Markdown Format**
   ```markdown
   ![Alt Text](/your-image.jpg)
   ```
   Example:
   ```markdown
   ![Sami](/image-1-1-768x1024.png)
   ```

2. **Grid Layout with Styling**
   Use this format for more control over image layout and styling:
   ```jsx
   <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 my-6 max-w-2xl mx-auto">
     <img
       src="/your-image-1.jpg"
       alt="Description of Image 1"
       className="rounded-lg shadow-md w-full max-h-40 object-cover"
     />
     <img
       src="/your-image-2.jpg"
       alt="Description of Image 2"
       className="rounded-lg shadow-md w-full max-h-40 object-cover"
     />
   </div>
   ```

   For a single image in grid layout:
   ```jsx
   <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 my-6 max-w-2xl mx-auto">
     <img
       src="/your-image.jpg"
       alt="Description of Image"
       className="rounded-lg shadow-md w-full max-h-40 object-cover"
     />
   </div>
   ```

#### Styling Classes Explained (Definitely use ChatGPT for this):
- `grid grid-cols-2`: Creates a 2-column grid layout
- `gap-4`: Adds spacing between grid items
- `my-6`: Adds vertical margin
- `max-w-2xl`: Sets maximum width
- `mx-auto`: Centers the grid
- `rounded-lg`: Rounds the corners of images
- `shadow-md`: Adds a medium shadow effect
- `w-full`: Makes image take full width of its container
- `max-h-40`: Sets maximum height
- `object-cover`: Ensures image covers its container while maintaining aspect ratio

### Step 5: Save Your Changes

1. Once your blog post is complete, scroll to the bottom of the GitHub editor.
2. Add a commit message summarizing your changes (e.g., "Add Winter Rush 2024 Recap post").
3. Choose "Commit directly to the main branch."
4. Click "Commit changes."

## Best Practices

1. **Images**
   - Optimize images before uploading (compress large files).
   - Use JPG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency.
   - Keep image file sizes under 500KB when possible.

2. **Content**
   - Write engaging, clear content.
   - Include relevant images to break up text.
   - Use proper grammar and spelling.
   - Keep paragraphs concise.
   - Include a call-to-action when appropriate.

3. **SEO**
   - Use descriptive titles.
   - Include relevant tags.
   - Write meaningful image alt text.
   - Add a clear meta description.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Images Not Displaying
- Verify the image path is correct.
- Check that the image exists in the correct directory.
- Ensure the image filename matches exactly (case-sensitive).

### Formatting Issues
- Make sure there's a blank line between paragraphs.
- Check that front matter is properly formatted with three dashes (`---`).
- Verify Markdown syntax is correct.
